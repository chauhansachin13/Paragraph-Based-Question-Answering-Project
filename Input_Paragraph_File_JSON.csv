    "context": "Albert Einstein, the German-born theoretical physicist, revolutionized modern science with his theory of relativity (E=mc²). Born in 1879, he initially struggled in school but later excelled in physics and mathematics. His 1905 'Annus Mirabilis' papers laid the foundation for quantum mechanics and special relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for explaining the photoelectric effect. Fleeing Nazi Germany, he settled in the U.S., where he advocated for civil rights and nuclear disarmament. Despite his pacifism, his work indirectly contributed to atomic bomb development, which he later regretted. Einstein’s genius extended beyond science—he was a philosopher, musician, and global icon of intellectual curiosity. His famous quote, 'Imagination is more important than knowledge,' reflects his unconventional thinking. He died in 1955, leaving behind a legacy that continues to shape physics and inspire thinkers worldwide.",

With her husband Pierre, she discovered polonium and radium, coining the term 'radioactivity.'

Despite facing gender discrimination, she persisted in her work, even during World War I, where she developed mobile X-ray units for hospitals. Curie’s relentless exposure to radiation led to her death in 1934, but her research laid the groundwork for advancements in cancer treatment and nuclear energy.

    "context": "Porphyrias are a group of 8 metabolic disorders affecting heme production, with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) being the most severe (1 in 75,000). Attacks cause severe abdominal pain, neuropathy, and psychiatric symptoms triggered by certain drugs, fasting, or hormonal changes. Diagnosis requires elevated urinary porphobilinogen during attacks. Treatment involves intravenous hemin to shut down pathological heme synthesis. Givosiran, an RNAi therapeutic, reduces attack frequency by 74% in AIP patients. The American Porphyria Foundation maintains an emergency drug network. Historical theories suggest porphyria may explain the 'madness' of King George III. Patients carry 'emergency letters' to prevent misdiagnosis as drug-seeking behavior. Liver transplantation cures hepatic forms, while gene therapy trials are underway for erythropoietic types. The porphyria treatment market will exceed $500 million by 2026.",

Patients develop severe burns within minutes of sun exposure and typically die from metastatic cancer by age 20 without protection. Diagnosis involves fibroblast testing for nucleotide excision repair defects. Treatment requires total UV avoidance with protective clothing, UV-blocking window films, and night-shift lifestyles. The XP Clinic at NIH monitors 150 patients using full-body photography to detect precancers. Research explores T4 endonuclease V cream to repair UV damage and oral nicotinamide to prevent cancers. Gene therapy trials aim to restore repair enzymes. The XP Society provides 'midnight sun' camps allowing outdoor activities under blacklights. Some patients survive into their 40s with rigorous protection, though neurological degeneration affects 30%.",

The nephropathic form manifests in infancy with Fanconi syndrome, progressing to end-stage renal failure by age 10 without treatment. Diagnosis involves measuring leukocyte cystine levels. Cysteamine therapy depletes intracellular cystine, delaying organ damage if started early. The drug now comes in delayed-release capsules and eye drops (crystals cause photophobia). Stem cell transplantation may halt progression, while gene therapy trials are underway. The Cystinosis Research Network connects 500 families worldwide. Adults with cystinosis face complications including myopathy (60%), diabetes (30%), and pulmonary fibrosis. The average lifespan has increased from 10 to 50 years with treatment, creating new challenges in transitional care from pediatric to adult specialists.",

Characteristics include severe developmental delay, absent speech, ataxic gait ('happy puppet' movements), and seizure disorders (80% of patients). Diagnosis involves DNA methylation testing. Treatment focuses on antiseizure medications (valproate and clonazepam are most effective) and intensive behavioral therapy. Ongoing trials of gene therapy aim to restore UBE3A expression in the brain. The Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics funds research that has reversed symptoms in mouse models. Sleep disturbances affect 90% of patients, often requiring melatonin. Adults with Angelman require lifelong care but can learn to communicate via assistive devices.

Neonatal hypotonia transitions to hyperphagia in childhood, leading to morbid obesity if uncontrolled. Diagnosis requires genetic testing showing paternal deletion, uniparental disomy, or imprinting defects. Growth hormone therapy improves body composition and cognition. Strict food security measures are essential - some families use locking refrigerators. The Foundation for Prader-Willi Research coordinates international studies of oxytocin and GLP-1 analogs to curb appetite.

The condition typically begins around puberty, with women affected 4x more than men. Diagnosis requires DSM-5 criteria including repeated attempts to stop. Treatment combines cognitive behavioral therapy (habit reversal training) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which reduces urges in 56% of patients. fMRI studies show abnormal connectivity in cortico-striatal circuits. The Trichotillomania Learning Center provides support groups and 'awareness bracelets'. Severe cases can lead to trichobezoars (hair balls in the gut) requiring surgery.
